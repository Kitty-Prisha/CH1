    <p class="p1">There is a strong emphasis on rice as a staple, with fish traditionally the most common protein. Freshwater fish are
    preferred to seafish, although barramundi, known as bhetki, is also common. Meat is also a common protein among
    Bengalis, with chicken and mutton being the most popular.</p>
