   <p><strong>Pizza</strong> pizza, dish of Italian origin consisting of a flattened disk of bread dough topped with some combination of olive oil,
oregano, tomato, olives, mozzarella or other cheese, and many other ingredients, baked quickly—usually, in a commercial
setting, using a wood-fired oven heated to a very high temperature—and served hot.</p>
